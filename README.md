//javascript is the most popular programming language.
//javascript is really useful for building websites and applications.
//javascript is one of the most powerfull programming languages and easiest to learn.
//javascript is the only client side language
//javascript is an interpreted language

//basics

//A JavaScript function is a block of code designed to perform a particular task. 
//A JavaScript function is executed when "something" invokes it (calls it).
//Example
function addTwoNumbers(x, y) {
    return x + y;
}
//That is a basic javascript function
//function is the keyword that starts declaring a function.
//addTwoNumbers is the function‚Äôs name, which is customizable ‚Äî just like variable names.
//(x, y) are parameters, variable names for the inputs a function will accept.
//return is the keyword that exits the function and shares an optional value outside.
//Once a function is defined, you can use it by referencing its name with parentheses () right after.
//Note that a function doesn‚Äôt have to have parameters.
//Example
function greetThePlanet() {
    return "Hello world!";
}

greetThePlanet();

OUTPUT:
"Hello world!"
//If a function _does_ have parameters, you‚Äôll need to provide values inside the parentheses when using the function.
//Example
function square(number) {
       return number * number;
}
‚Äã
square(16);

OUTPUT:
256

//Strings are values made up of text and can contain letters, numbers, symbols, punctuation, and even emoji.
//Strings are contained within a pair of either single quotation marks '' or double quotation marks "".
//Example
'This is a string. üëè';
"This is the 2nd string. üíÅ";
//Enclosing quotation marks
//Let‚Äôs say you‚Äôre trying to use quotation marks inside a string. You‚Äôll need to use opposite quotation marks inside and outside. That means strings containing single quotes need to use double quotes and strings containing double quotes need to use single quotes.
//Example
"It's six o'clock.";
'Remember to say "please" and "thank you."';
//Alternatively, you can use a backslash \ to escape the quotation marks. This lets JavaScript know in advance that you want to use a special character.
//Here‚Äôs what that looks like reusing the examples above:
//Example
'It\'s six o\'clock.';
"Remember to say \"please\" and \"thank you.\"";
//Properties and methods
//Strings have their own built-in variables and functions, also known as properties and methods. Here are some of the most common ones.

//length
//A string‚Äôs length property keeps track of how many characters it has.
//Example
"caterpillar".length;

OUTPUT:
11
toLowerCase

//A string‚Äôs toLowerCase method returns a copy of the string with its letters converted to lowercase. Numbers, symbols, and other characters are not affected.
//Example
"THE KIDS".toLowerCase();
OUTPUT
"the kids"
toUpperCase
//A string‚Äôs toUpperCase method returns a copy of the string with its letters converted to capitals. Numbers, symbols, and other characters are not affected.
//Example
"I wish I were big.".toUpperCase();

OUTPUT:
"I WISH I WERE BIG."
trim
//A string‚Äôs trim method returns a copy of the string with beginning and ending whitespace characters removed.
//Example
"   but keep the middle spaces   ".trim();

OUTPUT:
"but keep the middle spaces"
//Booleans are values that can be only one of two things: true or false.
//Anything ‚Äúon‚Äù or ‚Äúoff,‚Äù ‚Äúyes‚Äù or ‚Äúno,‚Äù or temporary is a usually good fit for a boolean. It‚Äôs useful to store booleans in variables to keep track of their values and change them over time.
//Example
var kitchenLights = false;
kitchenLights = true;
kitchenLights;

OUTPUT:
true

//Booleans are essential for conditionals to work.
//Numbers are values that can be used in mathematical operations. You don‚Äôt need any special syntax for numbers ‚Äî just write them straight into JavaScript.
//Example
12345;

//Decimals and fractions
//JavaScript doesn‚Äôt distinguish between whole numbers and decimals, so you can use them together without having to convert from one to the other.
//Example
10 + 3.14159;

OUTPUT:
13.14159

//Fractions don‚Äôt exist in JavaScript, but you can rewrite them as division problems using the division operator /. Note that the resulting number is always converted to decimals ‚Äî just like with a calculator.
//Example
1 / 3;

OUTPUT:
0.3333333333333333

//Improper fractions use the division operator in the same way.
//Example
11 / 10;

OUTPUT:
1.1

//To use mixed numbers, you need to add the whole number and fraction.
//Example
1 + (4 / 3);

OUTPUT:
2.333333333333333

//Negative numbers
//You can make a number negative by placing the - operator in front.
//Example
-3;

OUTPUT:
-3;

//You can also get a negative number by subtracting a number from a smaller number.
//Example
5 - 7;

OUTPUT:
-2

//knowhow

//When you load into a page on the internet your computer sends a folder of files including atleast 1 html file.
//The html file would include: <html><body><script src="/NameOfFile.js"/></body></html> it wont be like that but going down instead
//To use javascript you would need a script tag which looks like this: <script></script>
//Javascript is the only client side language meaning that it waits to execute code until its on your computer using a program called the browser
//Each browser has its own engine like safari uses an engine called webkit firefox uses gecko and chrome uses v8
//Javascript can change the display change data or fetch more data
//Javascript uses client side frameworks like: React Angular Vue, Svelte.
//Frameworks build ontop of javascript and make reading the client side code alot easier and more maintainable.
//traditionally javascript is an interpreted language meaning which means the code is read line by line instead of going through a compile setup.
//A compile setup is where its converted to the machine
